### NOTAM

A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is a message containing information concerning the establishment, condition, or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure, or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.
 
It is used to inform pilots and other aviation personnel about conditions that are not known far enough in advance to be publicised through other means.

NOTAMs are created and transmitted by government agencies and airport operators under guidelines specified by Annex 15: Aeronautical Information Services of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (CICA).

**[Prime Minister's Address – 12 May 2025]({{ site.baseurl }}/summaries/pmo/2025-05-12)**  
Prime Minister Modi declared that Operation Sindoor marks a **new normal** in India’s counter-terror policy. He confirmed the destruction of Pakistan’s terror infrastructure, warned against nuclear blackmail, and laid down a clear doctrine: **no distinction between terrorists and their sponsors**. Talks with Pakistan, he said, will now center solely on terrorism and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

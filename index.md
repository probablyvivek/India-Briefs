## 📰 Latest Briefing — 10 May 2025

🔗 [**MEA Briefing – 10 May 2025**]({{ site.baseurl }}/summaries/mea/2025-05-102)  
*India officially dismissed Pakistan's outlandish allegations about destroying Indian military facilities. Instead, it verified that Pakistan experienced **significant damage** to its major airbases and air defense networks. No religious facilities were targeted. No Indian weaknesses were revealed. The only deterioration occurred across the border, both in military capabilities and moral standing.*

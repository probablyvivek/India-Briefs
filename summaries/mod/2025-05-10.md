**Date:** 10 May 2025  
**Source:** [MOD Transcript – Operation Sindoor (10 May 2025)](https://www.mea.gov.in/media-briefings.htm?dtl/39491/Transcript_of_Special_briefing_by_MOD_on_OPERATION_SINDOOR_May_10_2025)


## A Brief Summary

India officially dismissed Pakistan's outlandish allegations about destroying Indian military facilities. Instead, it verified that Pakistan experienced **significant damage** to its major airbases and air defense networks. No religious facilities were targeted. No Indian weaknesses were revealed. The only deterioration occurred across the border, both in military capabilities and moral standing.

## Important Details

### Pakistan's False Assertions

* Claimed: Destruction of S-400 at Adampur, BrahMos base at Nagrota, and several airfields
* Reality: All untrue — India shared time-verified photographs confirming installations remained undamaged
* Claimed: Indian forces attacked mosques
* Reality: India emphasized its secular democratic values — no religious site was or will be attacked

### India's Verified Military Targets

* **Airbases Successfully Hit**:
   * Skardu (PoJK)
   * Sargodha
   * Jacobabad
   * Bholari
* **Additional Targets**:
   * Radar installations at Pasrur and Sialkot
   * Command & control facilities, supply centers, and air defense weapons systems along the LoC
* **Outcome**: Devastating impact on Pakistan's offensive and defensive capabilities

### Indian Forces: Prepared, Disciplined, Determined

* Despite agreements to pause operations, all three military branches remain **at highest readiness**
* **Any future provocations will receive firm responses**, according to Commodore Raghu R Nair
* Pakistan's confidence is weakened. Its deceptions provide no protection

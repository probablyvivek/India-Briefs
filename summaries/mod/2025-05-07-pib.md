## A Brief Summary

Operation Sindoor represented more than an attack. It delivered a clear message. India exercised its Right to Respond with precise execution, destroying nine terrorist training facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir. No civilian locations were harmed. No wider conflict was provoked. Only consequences were delivered effectively, conclusively, and without apology.

## Important Details

### Pahalgam Massacre Marked the Turning Point

On **22 April 2025**, Lashkar e Taiba terrorists killed 26 civilians in **Pahalgam**, Jammu and Kashmir, including one Nepali citizen. Victims were executed with gunshots to the head **at point blank range**, many **while their families watched**. This went beyond murder to become psychological warfare

* The goal aimed to **disrupt Kashmir's progress toward normalcy** and **damage tourism**, which had reached a record 23 million visitors last year
* Their approach used extreme violence to **traumatize families** and send a terrifying message
* The Resistance Front, operating as cover for the **UN designated terrorist organization** Lashkar e Taiba, **claimed responsibility twice** before attempting to withdraw their claims. The damage was done as intelligence had already **connected their communication systems to Pakistan**
* This attack represented **India's most devastating civilian terrorist attack since 2611**

### Operation Sindoor Delivered India's Response Without Fanfare

At **1:05 AM on 7 May**, India initiated *Operation Sindoor*, a **measured preemptive military action**

* The operation lasted **25 minutes**
* Its purpose focused on **eliminating terrorist camps**, not initiating war
* Tactics employed **precision guided weapons**, ensuring **zero civilian casualties** and **avoiding military installations**

### Surgical Accuracy Demonstrated Strategic Control

* **Only terrorist facilities** were targeted
* **No civilian or military structures** were affected
* **Every attack was supported by reliable intelligence**
* **Target zones were carefully chosen to prevent collateral damage**

This demonstrated **controlled strength**, not escalation

### India's Message to the International Community

India chose action over words

* **No media campaigns or threats, just decisive action**
* If Pakistan refuses to dismantle terrorist networks, **India will take action**
* India reminded the world that **we exercise caution but will not ignore threats**

Regarding the **UN Security Council statement from 25 April**
It called for *bringing sponsors and perpetrators to justice*. India simply implemented this directive

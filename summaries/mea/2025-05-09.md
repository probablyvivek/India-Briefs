## A Brief Summary

Following Pakistan's latest barrage of drones, missiles, and false statements, India responded with measured military action and steady diplomatic efforts. Strategic drone operations disabled Pakistani air defense installations while the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) revealed Pakistan's attacks on religious buildings, dangerous use of airspace, and misinformation campaigns. Simultaneously, India contacted world capitals and explained to the IMF why financing terrorism creates negative consequences.

## Important Details

### Extensive Drone Intrusion: Pakistan's Dangerous Strategy

* Between 8 and 9 May, Pakistan breached Indian airspace over **36 locations** spanning from **Leh to Sir Creek**, deploying **300 to 400 drones**
* These were not meteorological devices. Their purpose aimed to test India's defenses, collect intelligence, and potentially trigger conflict
* **Indian Armed Forces** neutralized numerous drones using various countermeasures. Analysis of recovered components identified **Turkish manufactured ASISGUARD Songar drones**
* A distinct **armed UAV attacked the Bathinda** military facility. Detected. Destroyed. Result: India 1, Pakistan 0

### Indian Response: Actions Over Words

* India countered with **armed drone strikes against four Pakistani air defense positions**
* **Verified radar destruction** at one site
* Pakistan's artillery attacks along the LoC in Tangdhar, Uri, Poonch, Mendhar, Rajouri, Akhnoor, and Udhampur resulted in **casualties among Indian forces**
* **India delivered a proportional response** intended not for escalation but to effectively counter aggression

### Civilian Air Traffic Endangerment: Pakistan's Reckless Behavior

* Pakistan **continued normal civilian air operations** despite ongoing military activities. Commercial aircraft flew near combat zones
* India, by contrast, temporarily halted civilian flights, placing safety first
* Case in point: A **Flynas A320** traveling from Dammam to Lahore arrived during intense Pakistani military operations
* Indian Air Force demonstrated **careful judgment**, preventing civilian casualties

### Pakistan Attacks Religious Facilities, Then Denies Actions

* A **Gurdwara in Poonch** suffered artillery damage, killing Sikh worshippers including the **Ragi**
* A **Christian convent** was also struck. Two students died, nuns suffered injuries, water storage and solar equipment was destroyed
* MEA characterized Pakistan's denial as a "deranged fantasy". India avoided targeting religious sites or civilians
* **Kartarpur Corridor operations suspended** due to security concerns

### Misinformation Campaign: Pakistan's Familiar Tactics

* Pakistan alleged India bombed its own territory. MEA directly called this claim absurd
* MEA pointed to funeral images showing militants **covered with Pakistani flags** as evidence they were not civilians
* False reports about Indian attacks on **Nankana Sahib** were proven untrue
* MEA confirmed that India exclusively targeted **terrorist infrastructure**, avoiding religious sites and civilian areas

### International Diplomacy: India Communicated, World Acknowledged

* **EAM Jaishankar** conducted discussions with

  * **US Secretary of State Marco Rubio**
  * **UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy**
  * **Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide**
* India underscored its legitimate right to self defense and **measured approach**
* International support recognized India's responsible conduct and evidence based position

### IMF Financial Support, Indus Treaty and Strategic Communication

* MEA highlighted Pakistan's pattern of **financing terrorism between IMF assistance packages**
* India reaffirmed that the **Indus Waters Treaty remains suspended**, citing continuous Pakistani violations
* IMF board meeting planned. India will present evidence against rewarding destabilizing behavior

### Jaish Headquarters in Bahawalpur Targeted

* India struck **Bahawalpur** which is the primary center for Jaish e Mohammad operations, connected to the **Daniel Pearl murder case**
* The complex was linked to **UN designated terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar** and **British Pakistani extremist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh**, who deceived and murdered Daniel Pearl

## Closing Statement

India's position remains steadfast. No desire for escalation. Zero tolerance for terrorism. Through precise counterstrikes and international engagement, India demonstrated how to combat falsehoods with facts and aggression with appropriate boundaries

**Source:** [MEA Official Briefing – 23 April 2025](https://www.mea.gov.in/media-briefings.htm?dtl/39443/Transcript_of_Special_briefing_by_MEA_April_23_2025)


## A Brief Summary

After 25 Indian civilians and one Nepali tourist were tragically murdered in Pahalgam on April 22, India abandoned diplomatic approaches. The Cabinet Committee on Security met and responded with decisive policy rather than mere statements. Pakistan's terror facade has been revealed and India ensured the world received this message clearly.

## Important Details

### Attack Addressed at Top Government Levels

* The CCS, led by the Prime Minister, labeled the incident accurately. **A massacre, not a militant strike**
* The patterns were evident. The response was unmistakable. **India will not allow this incident to go unanswered**

### International Support Strong and United

* **Pakistan found itself isolated** as even traditionally neutral countries voiced support for India and denounced the killings

### Border Connection Established

* The MEA stated plainly

  * **Orchestrated in Pakistan**
  * **Facilitated from across the border**
  * **Carried out by Lashkar e Taiba operatives**
* Though The Resistance Front claimed responsibility, everyone recognized **who actually controlled the operation**

### Diplomatic Penalties Through Five Significant Actions

1. **Indus Waters Treaty put on hold**. No collaboration while terrorism continues unimpeded
2. **Attari Check Post closed**. The exit route from India ends on May 1
3. **SAARC Visa Exemption terminated**. Pakistani citizens ordered to leave within 48 hours
4. **Military attachés removed**. This extends beyond informal diplomatic channels
5. **High Commission reduced in size**. Staff cut from 55 to 30. **Not merely symbolic but strategically calculated**

### Full Alertness Maintained

* Indian security forces were placed on **highest alert** throughout all areas
* This represented not just reaction but **deliberate preparation**

### Eliminating Terrorist Refuges

* India mentioned **Tahawwur Rana's extradition** as a clear warning
* **Terrorism organizers will be pursued**. National boundaries will not offer protection. Official documentation will not provide immunity

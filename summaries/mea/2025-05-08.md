**Date:** 08 May 2025  
**Source:** [MEA Transcript – Operation Sindoor (8 May 2025)](https://www.mea.gov.in/media-briefings.htm?dtl/39479/Transcript_of_Special_briefing_on_OPERATION_SINDOOR_May_08_2025)



## A Brief Summary

After Pakistan acted as both instigator and peacemaker by launching drones and missiles at Indian military installations, India answered with precise operations. Operation Sindoor Phase Two disabled several Pakistani air defense systems, including one in Lahore. No warnings. No announcements. Only results. And indeed, the international community took notice.

## Important Details

### Pakistan's Poorly Calculated Attack from 7 to 8 May

* Believing they had plausible deniability, Pakistan deployed drone and missile strikes against Indian military facilities across Jammu, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat
* Every attack was successfully intercepted by India's Integrated Counter UAS Grid and air defense networks
* Wreckage collected from numerous Indian locations confirmed Pakistani origin. Investigation complete. Evidence secured

### India's Response was Targeted, Bold, and Appropriate on 8 May

* India countered with exact strikes on multiple Pakistani air defense installations
* A radar facility in Lahore was **disabled completely**, not merely damaged but made nonfunctional
* India kept its response within the same category and magnitude. No escalation. Purely reciprocal action

### Increased Hostility Along the Line of Control as Pakistan Violates Boundaries Again

* Pakistan intensified unprovoked artillery attacks along the Line of Control in Kupwara, Uri, Rajouri, Poonch, and Mendhar
* Sixteen Indian civilians were killed, including women and children. These were not accidental casualties. This was intentional targeting of civilian populations
* India responded with strategic counter artillery. Controlled yet effective

### Misinformation Falsehoods and Rejection Pakistan's Standard Playbook

* Pakistan denied all connections to terrorism and alleged India had targeted civilian and religious sites
* India highlighted the contradiction. Why are your supposed civilians receiving military funeral honors with national flags
* As the MEA stated, Pakistan cannot complain when they use temples and gurdwaras as terrorist training grounds

### Recycled Propaganda

* Pakistan again claimed to have downed Indian aircraft. MEA reminded everyone

  * This comes from the same country that declared 2611 orchestrator **Sajid Mir** deceased until he mysteriously reappeared following international pressure
  * The same nation that harbored **Osama bin Laden** in a military community and referred to him as a martyr
* Pakistani falsehoods are not an anomaly. They represent a seventy five year pattern

### International Opinion India Maintains Ethical Standing

* The global community, from **Saudi Arabia** to the **United States**, supported India's right to respond
* Prime Minister Modi and External Affairs Minister Jaishankar maintained direct communication with key international partners
* India communicated clearly. Countermeasures do not constitute aggression. They represent defense

### Indus Waters Treaty Temporarily Suspended

* India halted participation in the **Indus Waters Treaty**, citing Pakistani obstruction, misuse, and refusal to cooperate
* MEA clearly stated. We have respected this agreement for over six decades even during conflicts. But tolerance has limits
* India cautioned Pakistan. Stop using diplomacy as a weapon. Water access will not remain guaranteed indefinitely

### Military Update from Armed Forces

* Pakistan launched more than twelve drone and missile attacks targeting Indian air bases. All were unsuccessful
* Indian Armed Forces retaliated by targeting air defense systems in Pakistan including those in Lahore

### Line of Control Artillery Attacks and Civilian Casualties

* Heavy mortar and artillery fire from Pakistan targeted civilian areas
* India's military responded according to established rules of engagement, prioritizing civilian protection while countering Pakistani aggression

### Pakistan Attempting to Use Religion as Cover

* MEA dismissed claims that India attacked religious locations
* In contrast, Pakistan fired upon a Gurdwara in Poonch and homes of Sikh community residents. Three civilians lost their lives
* MEA emphasized. India targets terrorist infrastructure, not religious sites. Pakistan conceals terrorism behind religious facades

### The True Beginning of Escalation The Pahalgam Attack

* MEA reiterated that the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam marked the actual start of hostilities
* Twenty six civilians, including one Nepali citizen, were executed with shots to the head by Lashkar e Taiba supported TRF
* Pakistan initially took credit for the attack through TRF, then attempted to distance itself when international condemnation followed

### Regarding Pakistan's Request for Joint Investigations

* India reminded everyone of previous cooperation offers. All were blocked by Pakistan
* Pakistan uses shared intelligence to shield, not prosecute, terrorists
* No more diplomatic games. India no longer believes in conducting joint investigations with those responsible for the problems

### Terrorists Given Honorary Burials

* MEA referenced Pakistani funerals for alleged civilians covered with national flags
* India stated. These were eliminated terrorists, not civilians. Pakistan continues its tradition of honoring terrorists publicly

### False Allegations About Indian Targets

* Pakistan accused India of attacking the Neelum Jhelum dam. MEA declared this an outright falsehood
* India has exclusively targeted terrorist camps. Any attacks against Indian infrastructure will trigger consequences

## Concluding Statement from MEA

India's actions have been

* **Carefully measured**
* **Specifically targeted**
* **Proportionate**
* **Supported by intelligence and necessity**

The initial transgression came from Pakistan on April 22 in Pahalgam. Everything since represents India restoring order. No regrets. No second thoughts
